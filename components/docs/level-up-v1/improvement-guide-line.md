Love the clean, airy feel—great typography, spacing, and an obvious CTA. What’s missing is your **edge**: the Hollywood background and your **AI-accelerated build style**. Below is a tight, recruiter-focused upgrade plan with plug-and-play copy you can paste today.

# What to fix first (priority order)

1. **Positioning + Hero** – make your differentiator obvious in 3 seconds.
2. **About** – connect stunt-world rigor to engineering outcomes.
3. **Projects → Case studies** – show impact, constraints, and metrics.
4. **Skills** – split into Front-End, AI/Agentic, and Tooling.
5. **Social proof** – film credits, logos, and named testimonials.
6. **Conversion** – Resume link, 60-sec intro video, Calendly, and email.

## 2) About (story, tight + recruiter-friendly)

**Section title:** From Set Pieces to Ship Dates

**Paragraphs**

> I spent a decade as a stunt performer in Los Angeles, including **2.5 years on James Cameron’s _Avatar 2_** as part of the core motion-capture team. Film sets demand precision, safety, and speed under pressure—habits I bring to front-end engineering.

> Today I design and build **accessible, high-performance web apps**. My workflow is **AI-powered end-to-end**: ideation, UX drafts, code generation, test scaffolding, and perf audits using GPT/Gemini/Claude inside agentic IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline). The result: **faster iterations, clearer docs, and production-ready UI**.

**Highlights (badges)**

- _Avatar 2_ – Core MoCap Team (2.5 yrs)
- Disney, Warner Bros credits
- Stanford collaboration (UX & SEO)
- Meta Front-End Developer Certificate
- AI-Driven Dev: agentic workflows, evals, & E2E tests

## 3) Projects → Case study cards (structure + sample copy)

Show 3–5 cards. Each card: **Role • Problem • What I built • Impact/metrics • Stack**. Add a **“Read case study →”** link to a dedicated page.

### Stanford RNA Department Website

- **Role:** UX Consultant & Front-End
- **Problem:** Inconsistent IA and low SEO clarity for a research program.
- **Built:** Rapid Zilane prototypes, standardized components, SEO pass, AI-assisted UX flows.
- **Impact:** +XX% time-to-content, Lighthouse SEO 9X→9Y, reduced bounce (est.) _(insert your real numbers or directional wins)_
- **Stack:** React, Tailwind, Wix, Playwright, Vercel Analytics

### Relive – AI Image-to-Video App

- **Role:** Lead Front-End
- **Built:** UI architecture, routing, preview-on-hover media system, Sharp-based image pipeline, analytics, E2E coverage.
- **Impact:** LCP < 2.0s on hero, preview errors ↓, conversion ↑ _(add your real metrics)_
- **Stack:** React Router, Tailwind v4, PostCSS + Autoprefixer, Playwright, Vercel

### Little Lemon – Restaurant App

- **Role:** Solo Dev (capstone)
- **Built:** Checkout flow, forms, reservation logic, **AI menu Q\&A** (Google AI Studio).
- **Impact:** a11y score 100, end-to-end tests passing, CI green
- **Stack:** React, Yup, Testing Library + Vitest, ESLint/Prettier

**Tip:** Put the **metrics in bold**. If you lack hard numbers, use crisp proxies (Lighthouse, CLS/LCP targets, bundle size, test coverage).

---

## 4) New sections you should add

### Film Credits (compact grid)

- _Avatar: The Way of Water_ — **Core MoCap Team** (2.5 yrs, Lightstorm/20th Century)
- Disney Studios — Stunt Performer (titles available on request)

> Add a short note: “Full credits available upon request.” If you can show posters or studio logos, keep them monochrome for tasteful credibility.

### How I Build with AI (one-screen explainer)

- **Plan:** requirements → user stories → wireframes (AI draft + human edit)
- **Build:** Cursor/Windsurf pair-programming with guardrails, test-first prompts
- **Verify:** Playwright/Vitest generated baselines, a11y checks (axe)
- **Polish:** perf budget, LCP/CLS targets, bundle analysis
- **Ship:** Vercel preview links, analytics dashboards, post-ship checklist

### Testimonials (tight + named)

> “Chien moved us from concept to a clean, fast site. He communicates like a PM and ships like a senior FE.”
> **— \[Name], Founder, AI Image-to-Video Startup**

> “Professional, responsive, and results-oriented. Exactly what our department needed.”

## 5) Skills (reorganize for clarity)

**Front-End**

- React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3/Tailwind, Vite
- State & routing: React Router, TanStack (if used)
- Testing: Playwright, Vitest, Testing Library
- a11y, SEO, analytics

**AI / Agentic**

- Prompt engineering & evaluation
- Agentic IDEs: Cursor, Windsurf, Cline
- LLMs: GPT, Claude, Gemini
- Patterns: RAG basics, tool-use/agents, test-time prompting
- Integration: Google AI Studio / OpenAI APIs (where applicable)

**Tooling & Ops**

- Git/GitHub, Vercel, PostCSS/Autoprefixer, Sharp pipeline
- CI checks, perf budgets, Lighthouse

_(Swap the current big icons for a tidy, multi-column list; recruiters scan text faster than pictograms.)_

---

## 6) Conversion upgrades

- **Add a “Download Résumé (PDF)”** button next to Calendly.
- **Add a 60-second intro video**: “Who I am, what I ship, how I work with AI.”
- **Make email copy-to-clipboard** and label the icon for accessibility.
- Keep the **primary CTA sticky** on mobile (“View Case Studies”).

---

# Design & UX polish

- **Project cards:** Add a subtle hover lift and a “Read case study →” footer link.
- **Testimonials:** Equal height cards; include avatar/initials for visual anchor.
- **Skills section:** Reduce empty space; use a 3-column text grid on desktop.
- **Navbar:** Highlight active section (aria-current), add a “Skip to content” link.
- **Dark mode:** You already show a toggle—ensure charts/images have dark variants.

---

# Accessibility & performance quick wins

- One **H1** (your name) per page; section headings as H2/H3.
- Add descriptive **alt** to every project image/poster.
- Ensure **focus styles** are visible on buttons/links.
- Respect **prefers-reduced-motion** (reduce big fades/slides).
- Images: export **AVIF/WebP**, set explicit **width/height**, `loading="lazy"`.
- Fonts: `font-display: swap`, preconnect to Google Fonts (you’re close).
- Track **LCP/CLS/INP** with Vercel Analytics and keep a small perf budget in README.

# One-week action plan

**Day 1–2:** Ship new hero + About, reorganize Skills, add résumé + video.
**Day 3–4:** Convert 3 projects into case studies with impact bullets & metrics.
**Day 5:** Add Film Credits, polish Testimonials, add logos.
**Day 6:** Perf & a11y pass (Lighthouse ≥ 95, LCP < 2.0s).
**Day 7:** SEO/meta + analytics dashboards; push a “What I’m building now” blog stub.

---

If you want, I can rewrite any specific section (hero/About/projects) in your code style (React + Tailwind) so you can paste it straight into your components. Also happy to craft the résumé PDF and a 60-sec video script that ties **Avatar-grade discipline → AI-powered shipping**.
